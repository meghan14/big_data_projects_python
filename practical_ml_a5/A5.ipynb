    "[Active learning](http://tiny.cc/al-wiki) is a certain type of ML algorithms that can train a high-quality ML model with small data-labeling cost. Its basic idea is quite easy to understand. Consider a typical supervised ML problem, which requires a (relatively) large training dataset. In the training dataset, there may be only a small number of data points that are beneficial to the trained ML model. In other words, labeling the small number of data points is enough to train a high-quality ML model. The goal of active learning is to help us to identify the data points. \n",

It is central to data integration and cleaning. The following figure shows the architecture of an entity resolution solution. It consists of four major steps. **I will provide you the source code for Steps 1, 2, 4. Your job is to implement Step 3.**  \n",

After that, it selects the most uncertain pair (If there is still a tie, break it randomly),  and call the `crowdsroucing()` function to label the pair.
