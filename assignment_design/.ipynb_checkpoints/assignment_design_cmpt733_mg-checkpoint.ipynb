    "Social network analysis is an example of a widely faced issue in data science industry. eg. paper citations. \n",
    "(in case there is a problem with getting the dataset, feel free to change the scenario to US government choosing potential immigrants to their country based on their social media authencity. We figured out a way to do that) \n",

Based on the results obtained. Answer the questions below and submit the answer file as answer.txt. Remember to not exceed more than 3 sentences for each question.  \n",
